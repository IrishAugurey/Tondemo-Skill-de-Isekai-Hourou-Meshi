# Tondemo-Skill-de-Isekai-Hourou-Meshi
My HTML and CSS educational project. It was created during the layout practice using a template.
The goal is to practice basic skills in working with semantic tags, flexbox, styles, images, and landing page structure. 

## Description 
This page is devoted to the character **Tsuyoshi Mukouda** from anime and ranobe *"Tondemo Skill de Isekai Hourou Meshi"*
It contains: 
- a header with the name and navigation
- a section with a heading and a button
- a section with a character description and three facts about him (each fact consists of a picture, a heading and a description). 

## Technologies used:
- **HTML5** (semantic markup)
- **CSS3** (flexbox, custom styles, basic responsiveness)

## Sources
Some of the texts on the site were generated using ChatGPT.
Images used on the site were found on Pinterest. The authorship of individual images may belong to their authors on Pinterest.
